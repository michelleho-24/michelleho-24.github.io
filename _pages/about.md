Hi there! I am a AeroAstro Ph.D. candidate in the [Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab](https://sisl.stanford.edu/), advised by [Prof. Mykel J. Kochenderfer](https://mykel.kochenderfer.com/). My research is in trustworthy autonomy to operate in uncertain environments without human intervention. Some of my work has explored belief space planning with optimal control, anomaly and failure classification with world foundation models and conformal prediction thresholding, and trajectory explainability with large language models. They have been applied to domains including classical control problems, lunar rover simulations, and mobile legged robots for autonomous inspection. 

I received my Bachelor's of Science in Engineering in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Princeton University, with a minor in Robotics and Intelligence Systems in 2023. During my undergrad, I was in the [Intelligent Robot Motion Lab](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/), advised by [Prof. Anirudha Majumdar](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/majumdar). My work sought to define a framework for comparing the complexity of robotic tasks. Please check out my publications to learn more!  


<!-- Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
